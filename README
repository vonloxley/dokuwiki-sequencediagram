Sequencediagram Plugin for DokuWiki

Generate sequence-diagrams using js-sequence-diagrams by Andrew Brampton

There is one configuration: ''sequencediagram_layout'' which can be 
''simple'' (default) or ''hand'' to make the diagram look hand-drawn.

All documentation for this plugin can be found at
https://github.com/vonloxley/dokuwiki-sequencediagram

If you install this plugin manually, make sure it is installed in
lib/plugins/sequencediagram/ - if the folder is called different it
will not work!

Please refer to http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugins for additional info
on how to install plugins in DokuWiki.
